From a production stand point, I conducted research to understand the goals and challenges that the website will address. Since the website is designed for a speculative future, user personas will be created by referencing the research done in place of user interviews. 

The user personas are portrayed by the characters that I have used in my video. The characters use the website to solve their mechanical issues and acquire the parts that they need

The user interaction aspect will be intentionally designed to be dated and clunky to reflect the types of technology that people will have access to in the speculative future. This will be considered in the creation of visual assets, colour palette and typography to illustrate the user interaction.

In the prototyping phase, I created a website and developed the  website conten. The mock-up prototype that I created were used to create the product video.

## UX 
- User interviews and surveys are usually the first step when designing the UX for the website. However, in this case there is no users   because the website is being designed for a speculative future. 
- Creating user personas will be designed through researching characteristics of the proposed speculative future. 
- User journey mapping will be derived from the user personas. The journey maps will provide additional context for the goals, challenges and circumstances of people in the proposed speculative future 

## UI
- Illustration of visual assets 
- Colour palette 
- Typography 

## Prototyping
