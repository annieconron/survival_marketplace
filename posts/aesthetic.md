In designing the “Survival Marketplace” website, I have chosen to adopt an early web aesthetic to reflect the scarcity of technological resources in the dystopian future world that I have imagined. This style choice is informed by the fact that older models of desktop computers have been used in space missions for their reliability and stability. These computers were built using older technology, however they are more efficient and reliable than newer, off-the-shelf models. Additionally, they were designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, ensuring they remain functional and operational throughout the course of a mission. 

By using an early web aesthetic, I am emphasizing the limited capabilities of outdated equipment and the need to make do with what is available in a world where technology is scarce. The aesthetic design of the website will be intentionally rough and harsh, creating a visual contrast to the clean, intuitive design associated with modern technology to impress on the viewer the collapse of modern civilization. The design choices will allude to the viewer that the marketplace is a network of individuals using the technology that is available, rather than a corporate entity. The website’s design will aim to immerse the user in the narrative of a world in crisis and create a sense of unease and instability.

## Colour scheme: 
The website will feature a limited colour scheme reminiscent of the early internet, with bold, contrasting colours such as neon greens and pinks, and bright blues and reds.

## Layout: 
The website layout will have a deliberate lack of symmetry, and elements will be placed in seemingly random locations, replicating the clunky, chaotic design of early web pages. This will create an unsettling feeling that will be reinforced by the overall narrative of a world in crisis.

## Typography: 
The typography will be intentionally jagged and pixelated, harkening back to the low-resolution fonts of early computer screens. This will allude to the use of outdated hardware creating a sense of unease and instability.

## Graphics: 
The graphics on the website will consist of pixel art, which will reinforce the early internet aesthetic. The pixel art will be used to depict the products being sold on the marketplace, as well as the overall design of the website.
