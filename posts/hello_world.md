The website proposal is built around a dystopian vision of the future, where the depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, and climate change have caused the destruction of modern civilization. This future scenario incorporates themes commonly associated with dystopian narratives, where society has collapsed, and individuals are struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world.

The website design will replicate the early web nostalgia aesthetic. The contrast between the nostalgic design and the bleak narrative of the website serves to highlight the harshness of the dystopian future, where individuals are forced to scavenge for resources to survive.

The website's functionality, modelled after Facebook marketplace, allows individuals to buy and sell resources they need to survive. This marketplace is a network of individuals using the available technology to survive, emphasizing the theme of individualism in a world where corporate bodies no longer exist. 

Overall, the website proposal fits well into the theme of dystopia, presenting a grim and unsettling vision of the future where individuals must rely on their own resources and the help of others to survive.
