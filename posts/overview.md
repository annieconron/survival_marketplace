The “Survival Marketplace” website serves as a speculative design project aimed at addressing the potential consequences of global trends such as climate change and over population. The website’s design intentionally incorporates dated and clunky elements to reflect the scarcity of resources and technology in a dystopian future. By providing a platform for users to access essential products and connect with each other, the website aims to prepare individuals for a future where self-reliance and survival strategies are paramount. Ultimately, the “Survival Marketplace” embodies the notion of speculative design, presenting a possible future scenario that allows for critical reflection and exploration of potential solutions.
