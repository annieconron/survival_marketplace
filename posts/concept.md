Current global trends portray global warming, fuelling environmental degradation, food and water insecurity, economic disruption, conflict, and terrorism. Sea levels are rising, the Arctic is melting, coral reefs are dying, oceans are acidifying, and forests are burning. These climate catastrophise predict a near future where essential resources become much less obtainable. In a world where global supply chains have collapsed, individuals will rely on creative solutions to survive. Humans will rely on technology that connects them with others on a local scale, not for convenience but out of necessity. 

I foresee the application of current e-commerce technology that traditionally facilitates access to goods and services of convenience will be transitioned to give users access to products required for basic survival. In a world where it will be necessary for communities to be more self reliant existing functionality of these e-commerce platforms such as chat rooms and review systems will also be a crucial tool for survival. 

The "Survival Marketplace" will respond to this dystopian vision of the future, where the depletion of natural resources, overpopulation, and climate change have caused the destruction of modern civilization. This future scenario incorporates themes commonly associated with dystopian narratives, where society has collapsed, and individuals are struggling to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world.
