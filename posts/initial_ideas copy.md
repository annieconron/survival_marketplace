My initial idea stemmed from a YouTube video essay that explored the confusing industry of virtual restaurants. Further research into this topic revealed to me how technology is changing our relationship to food and other essential resources. Virtual restaurants are an example of the extent to which humans rely on technology and outsourcing the process of obtaining resources that are necessary for survival. 

Through my research into this issue I decided to create a website that humans can use to gain access to resources. Unlike uber eats, the resources that users are seeking to obtain will be scraps and fragments of the resources left on earth. 

## Initial Ideas
- Product which solves a speculative issue 
- Create detailed prototype and user journeys  
- Through the user journeys illustrate my vision of a future world
