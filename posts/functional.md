The functional design elements of the “Survival Marketplace” encapsulate the characteristics of a dystopian future where people are desperate to survive the desert wasteland. The features listed below will enable users to find and purchase necessary goods to survive in a world where global supply chains have collapsed.

The community forum space called “The Last City” is a space where users discuss survival strategies, share tips, and connect with others in similar situations. 

The community forums and private messaging functions will aid in developing social context for this future world. In a dystopian world where essential resources are scarce, the chat rooms will reflect the social context of the world by revealing the struggles and hardships of individuals trying to survive. Users may share stories of their struggles to find food, water or shelter, and may negotiate trades based on what they have to offer. Through these conversations, users may also share information about the state of the world, such as the availability of resources in certain areas or any potential threats to safety. By allowing users to engage in dialogue the chat functions will be a critical tool for users to share information, negotiate trades, and develop relationships based on the shared goal of survival.

## Resource Listing: 
The platform will allow users to list the resources they have available for trade or sale. The resource categories will include food, water, medicine, tools, fuel, and other essentials for survival.

## Search Function: 
The platform will have a search function that allows users to search for specific resources they require.

## Transaction System: 
The transaction system, which will replace the traditional monetary system, will facilitate trades of essential goods and services that are necessary for survival. This emphasizes the idea that basic resources have become scarce and the survival of individuals depends on their ability to obtain these resources through local networks.

## Messaging System: 
The platform will include a messaging system that allows users to communicate with each other and negotiate trades. This function will facilitate a social exchange between individuals which will provide insight to the social context of the world.   

## Community Forum: 
The platform will include a community forum where users can discuss survival strategies, share tips, and connect with others in similar situations. Much like the messaging system, the forum will enable social interaction but it will provide a more complete view of the dystopian society.

## Resource Map: 
The platform will feature a resource map that shows the locations of various resources across the world. Users will be able to add new resources to the map and update the status of existing resources.
